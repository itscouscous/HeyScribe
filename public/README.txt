HeyScribe

Description
    A website that connects freelance transcriptionists to one-time transcribing jobs. 
    Our client is a freelance transcriptionist that saw a gap in the marketplace for a 
    single platform where transcription freelancers can find a wide range of jobs.

Features
-   HeyScribe functions like most online marketplaces. It hosts two types of accounts: 
    Clients and Scribes. Clients can browse and list transcription jobs.
-   Jobs can require prior approval from the Client. When Scribes requests the approval 
    for jobs, the Client that posted the job will receive a notification in their
    MyAccount page and review those Scribers based on their bio and average ratings.
-   Scribes are able to browse jobs and accept them on their own terms. Jobs that have 
    been accepted or requested will be visible in their MyAccount page, and will change 
    to requested or complete based on the status of the job.
-   HeyScribe has an accountability feature in the form of Client ratings designed to 
    incentivise quality of work. This rating will calculated into the Scribe's average 
    rating.
-   Jobs that are closest to the deadline specified by the Client will be displayed in 
    the homepage and labelled as urgent.
-   When a Scriber has uploaded their finished work, Clients will be able to request a 
    redo. If a redo is not needed, Clients will be able to download the complete 
    transcript and give a rating, which releases the payment.

Incomplete Functionalities
-   Given the scope and complexity of the undertaken project, we weren't able to 
    implement all of the functionalities. For example, the Job Information Modal has 
    elements that are only supposed to be visible depending on the user's AccountType 
    and JobStatus. We were also unable to implement the reviews system and the payment 
    functionality due to legal concerns. However, with more time and additional 
    resources, we would be able to continue to build it to reach its full potential.
